# Python-CIDOC-ORM
Python library to make creation of CIDOC CRM easier by mapping classes/predicates to python objects

# Status
Very Alpha.  Extracted the interesting bits from IIIF-Prezi and refactored to be a bit stricter.
Parses an extraction of the CRM ontology as TSV to generate class hierarchy and property/predicate mapping.

Collaboration and feedback welcome!
